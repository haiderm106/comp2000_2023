# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
      They are version control websites that can track the progress of a project. Personally I prefer Github. 
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
      Matthew Roberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
      Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
      Dave Pearce was the last commit and the first one was also Dave Pearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
      Since there have been no commits since August 2022, it can be understood that the projects might have been finished. 
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
